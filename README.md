Improved Reuse: Modules can be reused in different projects or parts of the same project, reducing development time and effort.
Easier Debugging: Isolating issues to specific modules makes it quicker and easier to identify and fix errors.
Reduced Testing Time: Smaller, self-contained modules require less testing effort, as only the affected module needs to be tested when changes are made.
Benefits of Modularity for Scalability

Easier Expansion: Modular design makes it straightforward to add or remove modules as the system grows, allowing for scalability to meet changing requirements.
Improved Performance: Breaking down the system into smaller, independent units can optimize performance, as only the relevant modules are executed when needed.
Enhanced Resilience: Isolated modules prevent the failure of one module from affecting the entire system, increasing its overall resilience to errors.
Simplified Maintenance: As modules are independent, it becomes easier to upgrade or replace components as technology evolves, ensuring the system remains scalable and future-proof.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit Testing:

Tests individual modules or functions in isolation.
Verifies that the code works as intended according to the specifications.
Integration Testing:

Tests how different modules interact and work together.
Ensures that the communication between modules is seamless.
System Testing:

Tests the entire software system as a whole.
Verifies that the system meets the overall functional and performance requirements.
Acceptance Testing:

Performed by end-users or clients.
Evaluates whether the software meets the business needs and user requirements.

Testing is crucial in software development for the following reasons:

Detecting Defects Early: Testing helps identify defects and bugs early in the development cycle, when they are easier and less costly to fix.
Preventing Errors: Thorough testing minimizes the risk of errors, crashes, or data loss in the final product.
